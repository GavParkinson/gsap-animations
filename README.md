# GsapAnimations

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## Information

This project uses the Green Sock Application Platform [(gsap)](https://greensock.com/gsap/) to animate page transisitons in Angular.

There are three different examples:
* Parallax - Parallax effect when transitioning between each section
* Slide - Each section slides in
* Fade - Each section fades in

Based on this article from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beautiful-page-transitions-in-angular/), changed a little to add some routing and some styling changes.
